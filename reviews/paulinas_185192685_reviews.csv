Collins, Suzanne;Catching Fire;Nice book! I loved it!!!!
Collins, Suzanne;The Hunger Games;I really liked this book! The idea of the Games is unique and keeps you hooked from start to finish. Katniss Everdeen is a wonderful character, and her journey is full of tension and emotion. Although, I didn't like the change in rules.
