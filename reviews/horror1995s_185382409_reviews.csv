Author;Book title;Review
McFadden, Freida;The Gift;I LOVE IT! yes yes yes, Frieda McFadden wrote a short Christmas novella that I can read in an hour... awesome!!! Where does she get her ideas? I need more...
Fitzpatrick, Becca;Hush, Hush (Hush, Hush, #1);I think that such books are not for me. It took me a long time to force myself to read to the end :/
Meyer, Stephenie;Twilight (The Twilight Saga, #1);uhhh, the atmosphere between the main characters seems so strange! This created world is definitely not for me, but it's not the worst book I've read either
Barnes, Jennifer Lynn;The Inheritance Games (The Inheritance Games, #1);it's ok, cool puzzle
King, Stephen;Needful Things;good, good and good again, but not the best!
King, Stephen;The Shining (The Shining, #1);I love this book! The suspense, the mystery, the twists and turns. It's brilliant! I want and need more
King, Stephen;It;AMAZING
Stoker, Bram;Dracula;WOW
Jackson, Holly;As Good As Dead (A Good Girl's Guide to Murder, #3);It's a good thing I managed to finish it. I guess I just wasted my time in the end.
Jackson, Holly;A Good Girl's Guide to Murder (A Good Girl's Guide to Murder, #1);I don't know how I managed to read this to the end. I guess it's just my will to fight. However, I will read the sequel.
