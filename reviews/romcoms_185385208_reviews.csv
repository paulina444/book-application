William Shakespeare;Romeo and Juliet;A classic of classics in love. How could I not give it 5 stars?
Meghan Quinn;How My Neighbor Stole Christmas;This is one of those books that you can read in one night! It's amazing!
Fredrik Backman;A Man Called Ove;A beautifully written story, full of emotion and reflection. The author builds the relationships between the characters perfectly, and the world he created seems almost real. Reading this book was pure pleasure.
Casey McQuiston;Red, White & Royal Blue;It was a decent book â€“ nothing groundbreaking, but nothing off-putting either. The plot had its moments, but it lacked what makes a book stay in your memory for a long time.
Emily Henry;Beach Read;The plot seemed promising, but the further I read, the more I lost interest. The action was too slow and the characters were inauthentic. It lacked depth and emotion.
Emily Henry;Beach Read;This is one of the best books I've ever read - moving, emotional and beautifully written. Absolutely fantastic! I couldn't tear myself away from the first page to the last.
Lynn Painter;Better than the Movies (Better than the Movies, #1);This is one of the best books I've read - moving, emotional and beautifully written. Very interesting and a good idea for a plot. I was not disappointed!
Victoria E. Schwab;The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue;SWEET! I love books like this!
