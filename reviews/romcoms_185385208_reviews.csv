Author;Book title;Review
Sáenz, Benjamin Alire;Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe;Wonderful! Very comfortable book. Quick read. I love the main characters and the whole book in general!
Green, John;The Fault in Our Stars;I expected more from such a highly praised book - for me it was simply boring. I guess John Green is not an author for me.
Black, Holly;The Cruel Prince;Very good book, kept me in suspense most of the time. I recommend it!
Collins, Suzanne;The Hunger Games;"Interesting plot, vivid characters and great style - but it lacked ""that something"" to give it 5 stars. I can't wait to start reading the next volumes."
Schwab, Victoria;The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue;This is one of the best books I've read - moving, emotional and beautifully written. Very interesting and a good idea for a plot. I was not disappointed!
Painter, Lynn;Better than the Movies;This is one of the best books I've ever read - moving, emotional and beautifully written. Absolutely fantastic! I couldn't tear myself away from the first page to the last.
Quinn, Meghan;How My Neighbor Stole Christmas;This is one of those books that you can read in one night! It's amazing!
Henry, Emily;Beach Read;The plot seemed promising, but the further I read, the more I lost interest. The action was too slow and the characters were inauthentic. It lacked depth and emotion.
McQuiston, Casey;Red, White & Royal Blue;It was a decent book – nothing groundbreaking, but nothing off-putting either. The plot had its moments, but it lacked what makes a book stay in your memory for a long time.
Backman, Fredrik;A Man Called Ove;A beautifully written story, full of emotion and reflection. The author builds the relationships between the characters perfectly, and the world he created seems almost real. Reading this book was pure pleasure.
Shakespeare, William;Romeo and Juliet;A classic of classics in love. How could I not give it 5 stars?
