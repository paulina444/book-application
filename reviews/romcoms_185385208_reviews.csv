SÃ¡enz, Benjamin Alire;Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe (Aristotle and Dante, #1);Wonderful! Very comfortable book. Quick read. I love the main characters and the whole book in general!
Green, John;The Fault in Our Stars;I expected more from such a highly praised book - for me it was simply boring. I guess John Green is not an author for me.
Black, Holly;The Cruel Prince (The Folk of the Air, #1);Very good book, kept me in suspense most of the time. I recommend it!
Collins, Suzanne;The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games, #1);"Interesting plot, vivid characters and great style - but it lacked ""that something"" to give it 5 stars. I can't wait to start reading the next volumes."
Armas, Elena;The Spanish Love Deception (Love Deception, #1);SWEET! I love books like this!
Schwab, Victoria;The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue;This is one of the best books I've read - moving, emotional and beautifully written. Very interesting and a good idea for a plot. I was not disappointed!
