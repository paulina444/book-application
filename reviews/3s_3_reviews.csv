Flanagan, David;The Ruby Programming Language: Everything You Need to Know;This book provides comprehensive documentation of the Ruby programming language (1.8.x and 1.9.x) by the language's creator, Yukihiro Matsumoto, and David Flanagan (from Javascript: The Definitive Guide and Java in a Nutshell fame).  Ruby is an easy language to program in, but it is not a simple language. This book is intended for experienced programmers who want to master Ruby. It is not a beginner's book, although it does take a bottoms up approach -- it is intended to be read in the order it is written. If you've got the capacity and willingness to read carefully and think through the examples, this book will reward you many times over with knowledge and insight.
